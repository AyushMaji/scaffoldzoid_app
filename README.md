## Technologies:
   - `Flutter` - Ui development 
   - `Firbase` - backend and Authentication 
   - `Bloc` - State Managment
   - `Shared_preferences` - Local Storage
   -  `Logger` - Error handeling
   -  `MVP` -  Flutter is the best way to deliver a mobile app MVP in a short time for both iOS and Android. Moreover, we can complete it with a much smaller team than we would need to engage in the case of building two native mobile apps
